        <br>
        <p>The first exercises we did during the first class, I found curious. In the sense that I didn't expect to create a connection with anyone or to look for it. I also don't get used to my word having the right to vote. So that anyone can join in to collaborate. In my opinion they made us connect in a certain way with ourselves and then with others. Creating this holoarchy.
         <br><br>
        Following all the activities in each class I didn't recognise the important movement in each of them. It seemed a bit repetitive between each of them. Although that was my first impression. I decided to reflect on what the whole experience had really brought me.
         <br><br>
        The point of view that one can really find a turning point in everything, seemed to me somewhat ambiguous, as it is easy to fall into the fallacy of generalisation. But at the same time I fell into it myself and found it very difficult to find these turning points among other projects. And I think it is always important to learn to realise what one doesn't know how to do, to try to learn how to do it or even to understand oneself.
         <br><br>
        Perhaps what I found most difficult was to give a title to the presentations of each group we made. Everything I said seemed absurd and ambiguous, as I have already said. But I didn't give up, I kept on trying.
         <br><br>
        I have never organised any kind of activity, exhibition, beyond a birthday party. In that sense I didn't know how essential previous references one can find. Nor did I know about previous projects. As well as the space directly related to the stakeholders that one wants to focus on.
         <br><br>
        What also seemed controversial to me was the fact that I had not made a stakeholder diagram so far. I was clear about where I wanted to focus, but I had never laid it out visually. That helped me to open doors to new stakeholders and new opportunities.
