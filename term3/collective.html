        One thing that pleasantly surprises me about this image is that no one has ever explained or taken the time to explain to me how the internet really works. How Google works. And to think that absolutely nothing is free, and even less in this capitalist world where even your time and your needs in the bathroom are accounted for. Every step we make on the internet creates our profile of person and counts us in groups studied to sell us in the marketing and in this way we contribute to the market that exploits and exploits us. Internet opens many doors, good and bad, we already know what constitutes this fictitious duality. It's like Linux, let's understand open source and let's take responsibility that we can't control everything that seems banal to us.

          Some of the snippets I got from the different classes are;<br>
          Protocol before the platform, to protect the entity itself. Protocol as a form of protection, as a manifesto.   <br>
          <br>
          How do you do commerce from technology? <br>
          From language?  <br>
          <br>
          Sharing is copying.   <br>
          Because from a technology point of view, sharing documents is copying the data profile to another device.   <br>
          It is perhaps the best revolution in technology? As was the printing press.   <br>
          <br>
          I also wonder what influences and consequences the liberal use of the internet and social networks will have. To what extent are social networks involved or visible in international political conflicts, be they wars, economic interests or pure bureaucracy?
