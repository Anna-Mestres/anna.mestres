          As the function of the JUGUEM project is to give new insights, I want to be able to offer the results of DD2 in an interactive way. By creating a random answer from the given ones. Creating a surprise and random effect for each question. And in this way add interaction on the website.
          <br><br>
          Creating in this way a surprise for each question with the answers given by the participants of the DD2. Giving a direct output, while provoking the result of reflecting on whether one agrees or disagrees. And creating that reflection is my goal.

        <p>In order to do this, we will use an array of the images, and then call them randomly each time the image is clicked on. From Javascript and html.
          <br><br>
        We also wanted to think about where this could be implemented on the website. Since the website is now composed of Game repository, Contact, Let's learn and Manifesto. Taking into account that it is a learning motive, aprendamos would be a good place to implement it. But also the aim of the manifesto is to create issues and make it as enjoyable as possible. So, it would be feasible in both.
