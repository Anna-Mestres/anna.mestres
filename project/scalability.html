        For the sixth question, the how, the structure the project should take, we can find between job/freelance, business/startup, non-profit/coop, Collective/network, Event/physical spae, Academic research, Documentation/guide. Among all of them for my project I want to focus on documentation. Although it can always be intertwined with each other, my aim is to provide new opportunities for new thinking and reflection. For this it has to be on a documented basis. Not so much as a guide, but as freedom of thought and reflection.

      <h2>Questions</h2>

        <ul class="a">
            <li>How much do you own of your vision?</li>
            <br>
            The truth is, not much. My views prescribe from decades and decades of thoughts and reflections. As I have said on other occasions, the evolution of thought is ordered holistically.  Therefore, every individual thought I have is determined by external outputs outside myself. This reflection is eloquent to say the least, since placing individual thought on a collective character makes us responsible for actions that are alien to each one of us but that we are involved in, and of perhaps totally catastrophic or different ethics and morals to each one of us. This is just another reference to the butterfly effect. I emphasise that among so much chaos as is proper to my point of view, it is when the actions of creating those parts of fluctuating connections between the past, the present and the imaginative future of my mind are mine. And those connections is thinking.
            <br><br>
            <li>What is imoprtant to keep close to you?</li>
            <br>
            The library. A space where an accumulation of thoughts and knowledge is created. Public, therefore, open source, if nothing else, for people who know how to read.
            <br><br>
            <li>Who should you involve to scale up?</li>
            <br>
            Those people who have the privilege of reflecting and having the space and time to understand how life works. But who also live in the reality of cruelty and understand the system from a critical point of view. But, everyone lives in this world, therefore, everyone is a victim of thought and for better or for worse of the class struggle. And therefore, they must be listened to equally.
