        <p>The main values we want to convey to the children are the alternatives of new materials that satisfy ecological expectations. As well as understanding how energy is transmitted in each material depending on its properties.
          <br>
          These are the steps we propose to follow in order to reach the expectations and the autonomy of the activity itself.

      <p>After the intervention we realised the value of language. Depending on the age at which the activity is applied, the language should be much simpler or more technical, so that the children can absorb the knowledge.
        <br>
        We also talked about the importance of having all the cables stored inside the machine. As perhaps, the effectiveness of having the ingredients already packaged with the corresponding measurements.
