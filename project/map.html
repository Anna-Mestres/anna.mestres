            <li><b>Did you develop your own experience with(in) the network of actors in which and for which you are developing your project? To what extent and to which actors (human/non-human) do you feel responsible?</b></li>
            <br>
            I developed my project with people with contact with children, such as teachers or parents. Since I feel responsible for the future that awaits the children, and even not wanting to get directly involved with them, so as not to modify their development in terms of my presence, which is more than superfluous in their life. I think it is necessary to make reference to the people who are going to be around you for a longer period than I do, so that you can take more time with them, therefore, deeper.
            <br>
            <li><b>Have you thought about expanding your community and from there your own experience? Where do you set the boundaries of your experiental community?</b></li>

            <br>
            <li><b>What do I know and not know about my own project? What assumptions, interests, values underpin my project and to what extent have I reflected on them?

            <li><b>In what sense am I corresponding to an interest, a need or an expectation of the socio-technical system or community in which I feel involved?

      <h3><b>Intention</b></h3>
        <p>Connect humans with nature to understand the synergy between them.
        </p>
        <br>
      <h3><b>Who</b></h3>
        <p> Children between 4 and 5 years old.
        </p>
        <br>
      <h3><b>Where</b></h3>
        <p> Enxaneta, elementary school from Viladecans.
        </p>
        <br>
      <h3><b>What</b></h3>
        <p>Bring natural elements, extracted from the ground without killing any plants, from the Pyrenees to the class. Let children interact with materials as they want.
        </p>
        <br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>The school uses the Montessori method, so every morning they work with environments. They are different spaces that are dipositan in the classroom with different activities. Children choose what and how to do in every environment, always respecting others and with care. In every environment there is a maximum of children who can be. These rotate and move freely, they cannot stay more than half an hour in the same environment.
        <br>
        <br>
        This workspace was approved to introduce children to all materials collected from the mountain. The bag full of materials was laid out without touching it, and they themselves began to make the magic.

      <h2>Conclusions</h3>
        <br>
        <div>
          <p>During all the working hours, you can see a lot of difference between children in terms of how they play. Either because of the family situation, culture or personality. At first they all represented a tree, no further than where it came from. They represented what was already known and shared in their lives. As time passed, some created urban structures, others performed actions and others reproduced objects.
            <br><br>
            Perhaps what frightened me most was the technological representation in natural objects. A group of children played as if they were Nintendos, PlayStations, etc. Implying, in many ways, that their connection with nature only comes from the materials of the objects that they themselves possess. And therefore, this relationship of respect is not created around other living beings.
