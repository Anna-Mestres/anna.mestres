            <li><b>Did you develop your own experience with(in) the network of actors in which and for which you are developing your project? To what extent and to which actors (human/non-human) do you feel responsible?</b></li>
            <br>
            I developed my project with people with contact with children, such as teachers or parents. Since I feel responsible for the future that awaits the children, and even not wanting to get directly involved with them, so as not to modify their development in terms of my presence, which is more than superfluous in their life. I think it is necessary to make reference to the people who are going to be around you for a longer period than I do, so that you can take more time with them, therefore, deeper.
            <br>
            <li><b>Have you thought about expanding your community and from there your own experience? Where do you set the boundaries of your experiental community?</b></li>
            <br>

            <br>
            <li><b>What do I know and not know about my own project? What assumptions, interests, values underpin my project and to what extent have I reflected on them?
            </b></li>
            <br>

            <br>
            <li><b>Am I committed enough to my project and to the community with(in) and for which I am co-developing it?
            </b></li>
            <br>

            <br>
            <li><b>In what sense am I corresponding to an interest, a need or an expectation of the socio-technical system or community in which I feel involved?
            </b></li>
            <br>

            <br>
            <li><b>To what extent do I welcome and promote diveristy and could adapt my project if new needs or demands arise? (How adaptable can my project be to possible changes?)
            </b></li>
            <br>

            <br>
            <li><b>Could my project be applied in other contexts / by other actors? What could be the future consequences?
            </b></li>
            <br>

            <br>
            <li><b>What futures am I promoting and who might benefactor be disadvantaged? (How desirable are the futures I am promoting with my project, and for whom?)
