        <br>
        <p>
          <ul class="a">
            <li><b>Did you develop your own experience with(in) the network of actors in which and for which you are developing your project? To what extent and to which actors (human/non-human) do you feel responsible?</b></li>
            <br>
            I developed my project with people with contact with children, such as teachers or parents. Since I feel responsible for the future that awaits the children, and even not wanting to get directly involved with them, so as not to modify their development in terms of my presence, which is more than superfluous in their life. I think it is necessary to make reference to the people who are going to be around you for a longer period than I do, so that you can take more time with them, therefore, deeper.
            <br>
            <li><b>Have you thought about expanding your community and from there your own experience? Where do you set the boundaries of your experiental community?</b></li>
            <br>
            I believe that you can always expand the community you work with. But realistically it is complicated. For my part, I can't dedicate as much time as I would like to. On the part of the community, they don't have the same ambition or the same time to get involved. So the boundary that I propose is on the one hand my mental health and on the other hand the one that the community itself imposes. Always respecting their needs.
            <br>
            <li><b>What do I know and not know about my own project? What assumptions, interests, values underpin my project and to what extent have I reflected on them?
            </b></li>
            <br>
            I am not aware to what extent what I am doing can help or is of interest. But from my point of view it is what motivates me and I consider that it helps, simply if only to reflect.
            <br>
            <li><b>Am I committed enough to my project and to the community with(in) and for which I am co-developing it?
            </b></li>
            <br>
            There are still many contacts I would like to get in touch with, in order to broaden the viewpoints. So there is still work to be done. And I think I can go deeper, and get much more involved. So those will be the next steps.
            <br>
            <li><b>In what sense am I corresponding to an interest, a need or an expectation of the socio-technical system or community in which I feel involved?
            </b></li>
            <br>
            On the basis of the political morality that corresponds to me as a being. Therefore, in all senses.
            <br>
            <li><b>To what extent do I welcome and promote diveristy and could adapt my project if new needs or demands arise? (How adaptable can my project be to possible changes?)
            </b></li>
            <br>
            My project is an online concept, so everyone who has access to the internet, will be accessible to them. Besides, there are always sections for collaboration and participation in the project. Starting from a filter, which in this case is me.
            <br>
            <li><b>Could my project be applied in other contexts / by other actors? What could be the future consequences?
            </b></li>
            <br>
            Yes, the main focus is on education but it really focuses on family structures. And in the system we live in we are all part of family structures whether we want to be or not. The future consequences of the project itself is awareness and reflection. And thus to open the gaps between generations, and to create a world that is freer in terms of structural expression and emotion. This would be the utopia of the project.
            <br>
            <li><b>What futures am I promoting and who might benefactor be disadvantaged? (How desirable are the futures I am promoting with my project, and for whom?)
            </b></li>
            <br>
            I am promoting a future where being part of a family is not a frustration but a pleasure and a choice. But at the same time this can affect people who are stuck in the past and tradition. 
            <br>
            <li><b>What is next?
            </b></li>
            <br>
        </ul>

      <h2>Intervention 3</h2>
      <br>
      <div class="game">
      <h3><b>Intention</b></h3>
        <p>Connect humans with nature to understand the synergy between them.
        </p>
        <br>
      <h3><b>Who</b></h3>
        <p> Children between 4 and 5 years old.
        </p>
        <br>
      <h3><b>Where</b></h3>
        <p> Enxaneta, elementary school from Viladecans.
        </p>
        <br>
      <h3><b>What</b></h3>
        <p>Bring natural elements, extracted from the ground without killing any plants, from the Pyrenees to the class. Let children interact with materials as they want.
        </p>
        <br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>The school uses the Montessori method, so every morning they work with environments. They are different spaces that are dipositan in the classroom with different activities. Children choose what and how to do in every environment, always respecting others and with care. In every environment there is a maximum of children who can be. These rotate and move freely, they cannot stay more than half an hour in the same environment.
        <br>
        <br>
        This workspace was approved to introduce children to all materials collected from the mountain. The bag full of materials was laid out without touching it, and they themselves began to make the magic.

      <h2>Conclusions</h3>
        <br>
        <div>
          <p>During all the working hours, you can see a lot of difference between children in terms of how they play. Either because of the family situation, culture or personality. At first they all represented a tree, no further than where it came from. They represented what was already known and shared in their lives. As time passed, some created urban structures, others performed actions and others reproduced objects.
            <br><br>
            Perhaps what frightened me most was the technological representation in natural objects. A group of children played as if they were Nintendos, PlayStations, etc. Implying, in many ways, that their connection with nature only comes from the materials of the objects that they themselves possess. And therefore, this relationship of respect is not created around other living beings.
