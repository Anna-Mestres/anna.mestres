        I have been going back and forth throughout the first trimester. I feel that I have lost and found myself many times. I think I've grown but I've also scattered. There's nothing wrong with that, it's just life. I've been struggling to meet what I think people need and what I want to do. Sometimes, if you're not hurting anyone, there's nothing wrong with doing what you feel and want to do. Besides, doing what you feel can contribute to the community as well.
        <br><br>
        In this whole journey so far, I have built more things and tested more things than ever before, especially with Arduino. Before the master, I didn't have the resources to work and exploit my skills, nor the time, nor the help of the whole team. Sharing my reflections on the topics each week has been difficult because of the time and my need for rest, but it is gratifying to feel that my opinion counts for something.
        <br><br>
        The themes I have been mixing and matching so far are Biomaterials and Energy. Looking at the complexity of society, the education system is the system that allows us to interrupt the fluctuating ideal world without having to address the whole economic system. Moreover, children are the future, but they seem to be the last ones to be asked what they want with the system, with their future.
        <br><br>
        Studying the different collaborations, I could work with, I would like to try to implement the intervention already done with Kai with the children's class. I would also like to get in contact with Xantana and Escola natura, as their working method is very much related to nature, and it could be very valuable to see how they interact with nature and education. Above all, I would like to continue working with biomaterials and systems such as the Arduino. For this reason, I have contacted Agro Biomaterials to do a workshop with them, to also find out what it is like to produce products with biomaterials.
        <br><br>
        The next steps I would like to take would be an intervention to understand how children understand what the toys of the past are and what the toys of the future will be like. Toys are the most fun way to learn, to define our first wishes and our personality. Everyone remembers some of the toys of their childhood. Toys are the way to link children to education. Building is a part of creation; it is a part of development and of turning one's thoughts into actions. As an exercise to develop the new toys of the future.
