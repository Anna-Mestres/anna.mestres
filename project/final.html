      Final Reflection

    <div class="refle">
      <p>
        I would like to start with a simple reflection, but it is not possible. For in many ways to see life in a simplistic way is only to stay with the closest spectrum. Or easier, in many ways. MDEF is not a master for enjoyment. It is a master’s for living. And that means that it is not easy. In many ways I feel overwhelmed and grateful at the same time.
          <br><br>
        It’s not the complexity of the master’s degree, it’s its intensity. You want to cover everything and you end up with nothing. I feel that depending on the work you do, the methodologies differ. Not all of them fit the situation or the expected effect.
        <br><br>
        I see the world every day and I feel that we repeat, repeat and repeat. Rather, we copy behaviours and reproduce them. Evolution is a set of repetitive copy and paste. But because we want to or because we need to? This master, although sometimes the repetition of events saturated me, was due to the awareness that each situation is different because they are different times.
        <br><br>
        We all have this eagerness to discover ourselves and create new frontiers. New points of view and to help as much as we can. We often exclude from the equation that we are privileged. That we have the right to study. And even to pay for a master’s degree. And with this privileged position we allow ourselves the luxury of questioning the axioms of life. Even with this power I feel that we owe the responsibility of ceding this privilege to the world. Perhaps this is the paradox that comes with wanting to improve the world, the privilege itself.
        <br><br>
        From my perspective it was not so much about reflecting on myself and my work, because I am an overthinking person by nature. Therefore, for me it was normal to reflect and criticise my surroundings. But for the first time in my life, I felt that my opinion mattered beyond my eyes.
        <br><br>
        What I value most in the whole process is the freedom of choice. Not to interpret as good with what is useful or necessary, but with what one feels and thinks. That fact is what has made it possible for me to open my opinions in public, with the Juguem project. Even if it is anonymously. Because even though I was brave enough to create it, we know that ideas kill. Ideals are personal but they can also be extrapolated.
        <br><br>
        And obviously life goes on after this magnificent adventure. My plan is to get rid of my fear of exploring and collaborating with people. The Juguem project will continue on its own. It will always be open and when I get a mail about anything it will be expanded. I don’t want to capitalise it or capitalise myself more than the system forces me to. So my intention is to keep reading and creating, and with this to keep making mistakes and growing. And with this let myself be influenced and influence people along the way.
