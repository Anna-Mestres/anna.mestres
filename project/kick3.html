      <p>During Design Dialogues my expectations were to create a space for dialogue. But I wanted the questions to be formulated internally. The explanation of my work was more a reformulation of the system and my expectations of the evolution of the project. But the fundamental basis was the interpretation of their realities, to create other points of view.
        <br><br>
      I showed my idea of creating a platform to give voices to other realities. To create a world where the boundaries of age and relationships are less toxic and more enjoyable for life. Even making philosophical references and critiques on the social system.
      <br><br>
      We can't save the world from ourselves, but we can make it more enjoyable.
      <br><br>
      Three key questions were posed to the participants, reflecting on toys and on their first social hierarchy, the family. These were the three questions, with the answers to each one.

      After reading all the answers, I think there are many questions that arise from them. Each of them are parallel worlds, similar, contradictory, shared realities, they are realities. Which in the end make up our world. Some are more emotionally profound, others more rational or logical. But all valid.
      <br><br>
      It makes me curious how some of them could be used for the other questions as well. But in general they give a good prognosis for each of your lives.

        <p>
          As the function of the JUGUEM project is to give new insights, I want to be able to offer the results of DD2 in an interactive way. By creating a random answer from the given ones. Creating a surprise and random effect for each question. And in this way add interaction on the website.
          <br><br>
          Creating in this way a surprise for each question with the answers given by the participants of the DD2. Giving a direct output, while provoking the result of reflecting on whether one agrees or disagrees. And creating that reflection is my goal.
