        <p>Following the interventions made, I have been given new insights. It is always important for me, as a technical part, to be able to analyse and test the hypotheses formulated earlier. That is why most of my interventions have to do with observation. For this part, I have always wanted to focus on the children, who in the end are the basis of the future. In this way, the two circles that mainly involve the child are the teachers and the parents or guardians.

        <p>Considering this, I should focus in the following interventions on parents and teachers, in order to observe their point of view. And create those alternatives. Since the previous processes have given me a lot of visibility on how children work, and how to try to help them.
