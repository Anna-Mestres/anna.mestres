      <h4> Hands are the tools of the human body that make what we create a reality. We could say that they are our machines. So I have used the hands as a metaphor for our own technology. And the antique camera as a metaphor for obsolescence and technological progress. And the phrase: "We have many hands", as a reference to the resources and all the information we have been given in this course, which even leads me to collapse.
