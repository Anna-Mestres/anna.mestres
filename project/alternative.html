      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        Past generations have provided humanity with a great deal of knowledge. This evolution is a consequence of shared knowledge and reflection. From generation to generation. Craftsmen, teachers, libraries, schools, bibliographies, books, paintings, photographs, films, songs, speeches, objects, etc. All these spaces, artefacts created by people create and help in the movement of society. This movement is necessary to get to where we are now. Every small contribution to knowledge makes it deeper. And it helps with the creation of different perspectives and alternative interpersonal and social worlds.
        <br><br>
        Precisely the aim of the JUGUEM project is to create new points of view among all. This thinking stems from the evolution of all the interventions made. And that each one of them offers a new reflection on the roles we play between ourselves and the world. <br><br>
        For example, in the first intervention with the biosizer we could observe how the discovery of energy between different materials through an output of light. Discovering the modification of matter with the form of the human being. As well as the control of the lights not only depended on the human being but also on the properties of the material and the shape. <br><br>
        Or the game of the forest with the children. Observing how the joints of the constructions limited the form. And from this, some children were stuck in their process of imagination within it. While others were more focused on the functionality of the piece. Or on the semantic form. All of them creating the links of desire between the frontiers of materiality and form of the game. <br><br>
        As well as the rationality of our reflections as adults and how we implement or even impose our realities, thoughts and feelings on infants. In the way we respond to the reflections. Because in the end this world is designed for adults. <br><br>
        As people we react to actions that provoke us, and we push actions to provoke. We create systematic paradoxes that are both hypocritical and redundant. But in the same way with them we find these little things that make us move. Movement that allows us to evolve, as a form of depth. And that's why the movement must not always be the same.<br><br>
        And really what I have understood is that we need to understand each other, to know what we think and what we feel. We need to communicate it in order to evolve all together, as a social organisation. But that's not feasible, it's another utopia. But equally, there is always a need for spaces where we can learn to understand each other and reflect on our own behaviour. And what better way to do this than with the game that unites generations and ourselves with the world.
