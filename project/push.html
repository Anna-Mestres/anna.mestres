      <h3><b>Intention</b></h3>
        <p>Connect humans with nature to understand the synergy between them.
        </p>
        <br>
      <h3><b>Who</b></h3>
        <p> Children between 4 and 5 years old.
        </p>
        <br>
      <h3><b>Where</b></h3>
        <p> Enxaneta, elementary school from Viladecans.
        </p>
        <br>
      <h3><b>What</b></h3>
        <p>Bring natural elements, extracted from the ground without killing any plants, from the Pyrenees to the class. Let children interact with materials as they want.

      <p>The school uses the Montessori method, so every morning they work with environments. They are different spaces that are dipositan in the classroom with different activities. Children choose what and how to do in every environment, always respecting others and with care. In every environment there is a maximum of children who can be. These rotate and move freely, they cannot stay more than half an hour in the same environment.
        <br>
        <br>
        This workspace was approved to introduce children to all materials collected from the mountain. The bag full of materials was laid out without touching it, and they themselves began to make the magic.

      <h2>Conclusions</h3>
        <br>
        <div>
          <p>During all the working hours, you can see a lot of difference between children in terms of how they play. Either because of the family situation, culture or personality. At first they all represented a tree, no further than where it came from. They represented what was already known and shared in their lives. As time passed, some created urban structures, others performed actions and others reproduced objects.
            <br><br>
            Perhaps what frightened me most was the technological representation in natural objects. A group of children played as if they were Nintendos, PlayStations, etc. Implying, in many ways, that their connection with nature only comes from the materials of the objects that they themselves possess. And therefore, this relationship of respect is not created around other living beings.
