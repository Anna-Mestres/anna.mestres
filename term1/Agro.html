      <h2> <em>Soil study </em></h2>
      <h3>The soil is everywhere, and as such it is not alive, but it gives us life. By studying the different types of earth, you really realise how much energy flows in it and how much need there is for diversity in the system. Thanks to the elements that compose it, it has different properties, important in different states, such as permeability or ph. Also, for a soil to be fertile it must contain at least three basic components; phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium.   </h3>

      <h2><em>Bees</em></h2>
      <h4>The behaviour of bees as well as humans is peculiar. As is the way they reproduce. What disturbs me the most is that I can't understand what they say. It is strange, because with all the advanced technology and logical reasoning, we cannot understand insects. I realise how much humans think they are superior to other living beings, myself included. Speciesism surrounds us socioculturally. </h4>
