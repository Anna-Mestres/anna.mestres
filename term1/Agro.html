      <h2> <em>Soil study </em></h2>
      <br>
      <p>The soil is everywhere, and as such it is not alive, but it gives us life. By studying the different types of earth, you really realize how much energy flows in it and how much need there is for diversity in the system. Thanks to the elements that compose it, it has different properties, important in different states, such as permeability or ph. Also, for a soil to be fertile it must contain at least three basic components; phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium.   </p>

      <h2><em>Bees</em></h2>
      <br>
      <p>The behaviour of bees as well as humans is peculiar. As is the way they reproduce. What disturbs me the most is that I can't understand what they say. It is strange, because with all the advanced technology and logical reasoning, we cannot understand insects. I realize how much humans think they are superior to other living beings, myself included. Speciesism surrounds us socioculturally. </p>
      <br>

      <h2><em>Agricultural biodiversity</em></h2>
      <br>
      <p>We walked the route from the Ribes Altes road through the mountains to the Arola refuge. Located in Ripollés, Girona. It is a protected area, where you can find different fauna and very busy in the summer season, as the refuge serves food and the views of the Vall de Núria are beautiful. But during the rest of the year it is only visited by hikers, hunters, farmers, boletus hunters and forest rangers.

      <h2><em>Reflection</em></h2>
      <br>
        <p>When we lived nomadically, it was humans who adapted to the natural aspects, but when we became sedentary, we created a social barrier to the control of space, therefore, nature. It created thousands of civilisations that disappeared, evolved, conquered, ..., the history of humanity. But in a certain way, we have ended up in a world where the distancing and ignorance of nature is mostly absolute, if it does not bring an economic good. A society where purchasing power is more important  than respect for nature.  A society where purchasing power is more important than respect for nature. And Marketing 4.0 is based on it. From the education provided by the great scientists, companies spread the idea of safety and confidence of the brand towards respect for the idea, in this case, sustainability. And yes, by buying a cardboard bag, you will feel fulfilled thinking that you are collaborating in sustainability, but it is nothing more than another trigger of capitalist production. Leaving with it a lot of pollutants in transport and manufacturing.
        <br><br>
        Besides, being aware that our culture is directly influenced by the ecosystem of each area, be it the language, dances, music, religion, among many others.
        <br><br>
        These are small day-to-day reflections, which personally frustrate me, because in many cases I don't see any solution. Because we can think of idyllic worlds where people eat what they cultivate, and do not consume more than they need. But the world is governed by a range of powers, and the power to control nature is in circumstance one of the most intrinsic in society, and in the capitalist world toxic to humanity itself.
