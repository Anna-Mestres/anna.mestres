        <h2> <em> Prototyping from 1 prespective </em> <h2>

          <h3> Sometimes I get impressed how much we are egocentric beings, just fighting for our existing.
            Living with the ideology of; if it is not useful or does not give benefits, it is not worth it to take care of it.
            Not only with the earth, also with the behavior, actions and movements of humanity.
            The importance falls on the purpose of usability instead of morality or ethics.
            <br> Since we were born until your death you are alone.
            And cause that person individualizing each other benefit the state-imposed control, contributing with the catastrophe of involving the world in our destruction.
            So flowing in this exploitative system, just makes us compare between us and forget about different realities or feelings that are flowing with us.
            That psychological movement just makes us collaborate with the system. Makes me question; which energies we have when we work together? Which sinergy? How we can help eachother with different beens? ... But all of them are generative question, nothing personal.
            <br>
            I do not have problems with relationships with people. I am alwas mad and sad, but for the system not for the persons, even knowing the people makes the socity.
            But I have a hate love relationship with the plants. I am allergic to some plants. Instead of giving me Oxygen they give me poisson. As Humans been for the rest of the planet.
            So can i correlate my existing with others existing and breaking that trust issues with the plants. And not just respect them, love them.
            <em> Which energy flows between a plant and me? </em> <br>
            So for 1 day I spent living with a mint plant. </h3>

          <ol>
            <em>9:00</em> The plant does not give me allergy so I can live with it.<br>
            <em>10:30</em> I start recordering in my house, with my sister and my dog. I do not interact with the plant that much. It is like an object more. <br>
            <em>11:00</em> We move with my dog. She just smell it. I am trying to move with the pant close to me, it feels otherwise far away. <br>
            <em>11:30</em> I have tried to imitate the plant, as if my hands were its leaves and it will try to catch the sunlight. If I close the fingers of my hand, it keeps the heat in more. I have also noticed that the plant only emits a minty smell when you touch it (it feels in danger).
            I wonder why the plant will follow this hierarchy in its shape. Is it to capture more energy? Is it to protect the small new leaves and help it grow? <br>
            <em>12:30</em> I have started cooking. I act as if the plant is just another object if I don't have it on me. Every time I am on my mobile phone I feel bad that I am not paying attention to the plant but to a machine that is not alive. <br>
            <em>13:15</em> We are going to the beach with the bike. I am excited to see how the plant is with me in the beach. <br>
            <em>13:30</em> We had some technical problems, the bike fell to the ground, with the plant. The camera has been disassembled and I can't put it back together again. I will have to change the way I record. <br>
            <em>14:10</em> We have arrived at the beach. On the way some people have been staring and laughing at the plant. I guess because of its movements due to the speed. We stopped when we crossed the road because of the contradiction of the pollution. I am happy. <br>
            <em>14:30</em>
