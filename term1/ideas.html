        <h2> <em> Prototyping from 1 prespective </em> <h2>

          <h3> Sometimes I get impressed how much we are egocentric beings, just fighting for our existing.
            Living with the ideology of; if it is not useful or does not give benefits, it is not worth it to take care of it.
            Not only with the earth, also with the behavior, actions and movements of humanity.
            The importance falls on the purpose of usability instead of morality or ethics.
            <br> Since we were born until your death you are alone.
            And cause that person individualizing each other benefit the state-imposed control, contributing with the catastrophe of involving the world in our destruction.
            So flowing in this exploitative system, just makes us compare between us and forget about different realities or feelings that are flowing with us.
            That psychological movement just makes us collaborate with the system. Makes me question; which energies we have when we work together? Which sinergy? How we can help eachother with different beens? ... But all of them are generative question, nothing personal.
            <br>
            I do not have problems with relationships with people. I am alwas mad and sad, but for the system not for the persons, even knowing the people makes the socity.
            But I have a hate love relationship with the plants. I am allergic to some plants. Instead of giving me Oxygen they give me poisson. As Humans been for the rest of the planet.
            So can i correlate my existing with others existing and breaking that trust issues with the plants. And not just respect them, love them.
            <em> Which energy flows between a plant and me? </em> <br>
            So for 1 day I spent living with a mint plant. </h3>

        <h2><em> Diary </em> </h2>
        <h3><em>04/11/2021</em> <br>
          <ol>
            <em>9:00</em> The plant does not give me allergy so I can live with it.<br>
            <em>10:30</em> I start recordering in my house, with my sister and my dog. I do not interact with the plant that much. It is like an object more. <br>
            <em>11:00</em> We move with my dog. She just smell it. I am trying to move with the pant close to me, it feels otherwise far away. <br>
            <em>11:30</em> I have tried to imitate the plant, as if my hands were its leaves and it will try to catch the sunlight. If I close the fingers of my hand, it keeps the heat in more. I have also noticed that the plant only emits a minty smell when you touch it (it feels in danger).
            I wonder why the plant will follow this hierarchy in its shape. Is it to capture more energy? Is it to protect the small new leaves and help it grow? <br>
            <em>12:30</em> I have started cooking. I act as if the plant is just another object if I don't have it on me. Every time I am on my mobile phone I feel bad that I am not paying attention to the plant but to a machine that is not alive. <br>
            <em>13:15</em> We are going to the beach with the bike. I am excited to see how the plant is with me in the beach. <br>
            <em>13:30</em> We had some technical problems, the bike fell to the ground, with the plant. The camera has been disassembled and I can't put it back together again. I will have to change the way I record. <br>
            <em>14:10</em> We have arrived at the beach. On the way some people have been staring and laughing at the plant. I guess because of its movements due to the speed. We stopped when we crossed the road because of the contradiction of the pollution. I am happy. <br>
            <em>14:30</em> I have started to eat. I've eaten an egg and I've put the shell on the plant because it's good for them. So in the end we both ate together. I am happy to have a plant next to me, I have started to talk to her more. But I feel uncomfortable with the camera. <br>
            <em>15:00</em> We have the class now. It's hailing in Gava and I can't go back with the bike. I know the rain will be good for the plant, but not for me as I have been ill this week. I don't have much battery on my mobile either. I don't know what to do. <br>
            <em>15:30</em> In the end I stayed on the beach so that I could follow the class better. But it's very late, I have a meeting in 20 minutes and I won't have time to get there and my mobile doesn't have any battery left. I'm going to start heading home as fast as I can. <br>
            <em>16:10</em> After making the meeting and not arriving on time. I am calm. <br>
            <em>17:00</em> I am going with a friend to drink a coffee. It is raining a lot <br>
            <em>19:00</em> Night has fallen. We went to have coffee on the terrace so that the plant could be in the rain and we could be out of the rain. She was almost run over by a police car. It seems that everybody is in a good mood for a plant.  <br>
            <em>20:00</em> I decided to go to the cinema to watch a movie with my friends. Now we are going to take the bus to Barcelona.  <br>
            <em>20:45</em> We have arrived at the cinema, we are going to stay in the bar and have a few beers and a bite to eat before the film. Everybody loves the plant and talks to it. <br>
            <em>21:45</em> The film, Titane, is about to start. <br>
            <em>23:35</em> The movie was super weird, but it was nice to be with my friends and the plant. Although I think it got a bit stale after so much movement. we are going to take the last train.  <br>
            <em>00:35</em> We just got home, I'm super tired. I'm going straight to sleep near the plant.  <br>

      <div class="Observations">
        <h2> <em>Observation</em> </h2>
        <h3> After experiencing the staging of living with a plant, I have realised how selfish I am. It is hard to superimpose a living being that cannot fight for its own well-being or needs on mine. I have been able to see that this relationship of power between human beings and nature is present in my daily life, even without malicious intent.
          For my part, as the day progressed, I increasingly mediated my movements and actions in front of the plant. Even so, I always put my needs before its needs. I suppose, in part, because it was me who had to move it and therefore, it was me who possessed that power of choice. One could ask the Plant how she felt, to fully know all the mistakes I made. <br>
          After all, I noticed that although it was more complicated for me to do things, as I had to think in two, the synergy that flowed between me and the plant allowed me to have a much happier and therefore more affective attitude and to be more efficient. I would love to hear your comments on The Plant. <br>
