          <h3> Sometimes I get impressed how much we are egocentric beings, just fighting for our existing.
            Living with the ideology of; if it is not useful or does not give benefits, it is not worth it to take care of it.
            Not only with the earth, also with the behavior, actions and movements of humanity.
            The importance falls on the purpose of usability instead of morality or ethics.
            <br> Since we were born until your death you are alone.
            And cause that person individualizing each other benefit the state-imposed control, contributing with the catastrophe of involving the world in our destruction.
            So flowing in this exploitative system, just makes us compare between us and forget about different realities or feelings that are flowing with us.
            That psychological movement just makes us collaborate with the system. Makes me question; which energies we have when we work together? Which sinergy? How we can help eachother with different beens? ... But all of them are generative question, nothing personal.
            <br>
            I do not have problems with relationships with people. I am alwas mad and sad, but for the system not for the persons, even knowing the people makes the socity.
            But I have a hate love relationship with the plants. I am allergic to some plants. Instead of giving me Oxygen they give me poisson. As Humans been for the rest of the planet.
            So can i correlate my existing with others existing and breaking that trust issues with the plants. And not just respect them, love them.
            <em> Which energy flows between a plant and me? </em> <br>
            So for 1 day I spent living with a mint plant. </h3>
