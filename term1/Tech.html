        <h2> Usefull-Useless </h2>
        <h4> The function to make a machine completly useless, with feelings as the central concept. Because a feeling representation machine does not attach to anything funtional. At least is what I understood about the stands of the project.
        But confusse me and also I have some philosophical questions about it. <br>
        <br><em> Is semantics useless? Are feelings useless?</em><br> As soon as something is useless, it is correlated with something that has only semantic value, such as emotional. Therefore the very right to be human is useless, according to the logic of the premise, since it is only a semantic value to have a right.
        <br>From the point of view of technology, that is what is thought. This could be used to understand the dissipation of those robot-people who work in technology and science and live totally detached from their emotions. Or the same capitalist system that exploits people and does not take emotions into account, because they are "useless", as they do not help to increase the economic profit.
        <br>What I am getting at here is the inflection that is created between the industrial system and the individual. Emotions are the language of the subconscious and without them we are not and do not exist.<br>
        And here becomes the <em>Almost Useless Machine.</em>
