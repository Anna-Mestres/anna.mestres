        <h2> Network Initiation </h2>

        <p> From the network we can see how it creates new images of people that do not exist. As a context, the effectiveness of the network is based on how it is trained. Although we can see some errors in some images, we can also identify that they could be real people even if they do not exist today, perhaps at some point in history they did. </p>

        <p>In the image uploading exercise, I wanted to try an experiment and upload an image that the network itself created. Actually, it was a screenshot. </p>

        <img alt="error" src="../images/EI/error.jpg" >
        <br>
        <p> It started by creating this image, and some errors. But in the end it didn't create any other image and it was just an error. We don't know where or why in the programming or network connections that happens.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>After all, we uploaded another picture to test and it worked.</p>

        <h4> The evolution of food towards its degradation is used as a metaphor for life itself. It explores the human behaviour towards nature, with the capitalist system as the catalyst.
<br>The focus is on the exploitation of food systems and the generated waste that feeds the same. The speculation explores not only the benefit of the privilege but also the aspect of us Homo sapiens being a speciesist entity in this ecosystem.</h4>
