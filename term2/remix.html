          The definition of biomaterials causes me a lot of havoc. Because designers use the word as bio-based materials, but scientists, engineers and doctors use the word as materials that can be used in the body.
          <br><br>
          But of course what does the dictionary say, both the Spanish <a href="https://dle.rae.es/biomaterial?m=form">(rae)</a> and the French <a href="https://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/biomat%C3%A9riau/9440">(larousse)</a> only allude to the scientific definition. But the English dictionary <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/biomaterial">(Cambridge)</a> does define both options. So it is not wrong when we speak in English to talk about biomaterials as bio based materials. As for the other languages, they would have to broaden their meanings.
          <br><br>
        <div class="billion">
          <p>Biomaterial is
            <em>
              <ol>
                <li>a substance that is naturally produced, for example by plants or insects, and can be used as a material for making things or as fuel.</li>
                <br>
                <li>a substance that can be used in someone's body to help with a disease, injury, or other medical condition.</li>
            </ol></em>
            meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary

          One of the great qualities of biomaterials is that they can be made from waste, especially organic waste. This helps to create a cleaner world. But at the same time we have to think about the consequences of creating these materials, as they come from natural raw materials, which in some way also participate in this environmental exploitation. So, it is clear that biomaterials are a good measure to curb polluting materials, but as long as you don't use exploitative tools.
          <br><br>
          Depending on the materials used in the process of creating the biomaterial, it will have different properties. It is clear that the environmental characteristics both at the time of its creation and in the drying process will also change these characteristics.
          <br><br>
          As is evident, common plastics are compared with biomaterials. Since the plastics revolution, these common plastics have been exploited and improved for mass production.  And of course, their properties are much better for production than biomaterials, which in my opinion is due to the investment of money in the 1960s. And therefore, I think that if there was more investment in biomaterials, they could explore many more areas of production, but at the same time, that is the place where these materials have no way out, as they try to escape from the system of overproduction itself. The manufacturing processes of biomaterials also leave much to be desired.
          <br><br>
          What I mean is that scientific, chemical and physical investment in biomaterials should be fundamental to their own technological advancement. Not only in a form of design experimentation, but scientifically in an atomic form.
