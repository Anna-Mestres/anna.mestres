          The definition of biomaterials causes me a lot of havoc. Because designers use the word as bio-based materials, but scientists, engineers and doctors use the word as materials that can be used in the body.
          <br><br>
          But of course what does the dictionary say, both the Spanish <a href="https://dle.rae.es/biomaterial?m=form">(rae)</a> and the French <a href="https://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/biomat%C3%A9riau/9440">(larousse)</a> only allude to the scientific definition. But the English dictionary <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/biomaterial">(Cambridge)</a> does define both options. So it is not wrong when we speak in English to talk about biomaterials as bio based materials. As for the other languages, they would have to broaden their meanings.

          <p>Biomaterial is
            <em>
              <ol>
                <li>a substance that is naturally produced, for example by plants or insects, and can be used as a material for making things or as fuel.</li>
                <br>
                <li>a substance that can be used in someone's body to help with a disease, injury, or other medical condition.</li>
            </ol></em>
