        <br>
        <p>The implication of design is more than something personal and collective, it is influenced and evolution, it is the act of creating. Design is the key to our species, since prehistoric times until today. All great evolution has always been accompanied by design. From a theoretical point of view, there are many ways of dividing a design. Always systematized, provoked by the human disdain to label everything. But, if we leave the subjective ideas behind, we can observe that everything around us is designed. Regardless of the author or its intention or value. That is why the action of creating is the most valuable tool when it comes to change. The nature in which we live demands change because of evolution. Design cannot and does not have the capacity to find a definitive solution. Precisely because of this same natural evolution of things.
          <br><br>
        Even though the definition of design seems to me to be not very resolute, not very delicate. Because it almost always falls into the error of generalising. Also, the duality of meanings also makes us sinners of toxic reasoning. When the egalitarians are excluding the accuracy of words is in vain. And the fact is that the act of designing leads to new points of view, to open looks. Since the creation of one can be the improvement of the other. But if this connection between people does not happen. These moments of thinking and understanding will never happen, nor will they evolve.
        <br><br>
        Design can be involved as a form of power and control, but also as a form of equity. Giving personal or collective independence to creation. In the capitalist world, economic participation rules the system as an obligation of intentions. Thus, the design is made explicit as a tool to get it. As we see in marketing, packaging, or any product focused on a public with similar roles. Provoking the participants, the exploited and the exploiters. That design is the fundamental basis for attracting and continuing to play the roulette of luck/unluck of capitalism.
        <br><br>
        Distributed design as an intention of bringing spaces of expression and autonomy. Would help in giving more freedom to individuals, as a power of automation, whether personal or collective. But it would still collaborate in the paradox of the capitalist exploiter. But the conscious design of a reaffirmation of a form of manipulation of the sense of care. It would be another form of control but being the step towards an improvement of distribution.
