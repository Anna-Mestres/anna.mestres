        <h2>What is Future?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          The future is all that will be, through the chaos within the butterfly effect. As being is relative,
          like the meaning of living, there will always be more than one future, as there is more than one present or past, in a metaphysical point of view, different realities.<br>
          <br>
          Moreover, as a person the future is hope. Without hope there is no sense at all of a reason for being in this world, therefore, a future. <br>
          <br>
          The vision of the future depends on the vision of the present and the past. Thinking about the fluctuation of time, things, space and actions, we visualise the future at every point in our lives differently.
          There is no congenital thinking about the future, it is subjective and variant.
          But, the question I intend to show is <em>whether we are able to express the future without putting humanity at the centre of the universe.</em>

        <h2>About<a href="https://medium.com/iam-journal/the-everything-manifesto-a-thought-experiment-for-the-next-billion-seconds-bcd9b9c938dc">"The Everything Manifesto"</a></h2>
        <br>
        <p>They define the Manifesto as;<br>
          <em>A proposal for (re)designing tools and systems to better understand the complexity of the interrelationships and interdependencies between the digital economy and the environmental emergency.
          </em><br></p>
          <br><h3>Reflections</h3><br>
          <p>
          After the different definitions of a billion, this question arises.   <br>
            <em>What happens when billions of humans, spend billions of seconds using billions of smartphones, concentrating money and power in the hands of a few billionaires who run corporations that manufacture billions of devices made of rare minerals used to extract and process billions of data points in data centers that consume billions of kilowatt-hours of electricity generating billions of tons of carbon emissions?
            </em>
          <br>
          <br>The controversial thing about it is that after having a different prespective of what a billion is, and being able to be other things, it creates a great metaphor and paradox of it.
          Because, the same question can be other a billion things. <br>
          <br>Another thing that in my opinion is very successful is to change the name of climate cahange to envirionmental emergency.<br>
          <br>And also, to criticise capitalism itself, which is driven by human error, that arrogance towards power. Falling into individualisation or the absolution of emotions for the sake of a mercantile good. Not to mention the superior positioning above any species. And the growing inequalities between classes. Which is more evidence to me of the clear stagnation between the working class and the climate emergency. For as evident as it is, the working class does not have the tools to change the situation. Because in the end fighting for the climate emergency is a privilege.

        <h2>WTF is internet?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>It’s about a global connection of computers.<br>
          A billions of connections where you can find everything, as an implication of something.<br>
          <br>
          I will say it is the algebraic image of computers in our lives, but maybe in the future it will be the metaverse.<br>
          <br>
          A few years ago I thought about it. I realised that we systematically search the internet for what we want to know. So in my opinion, for humans, it's not just a way to connect, it's a way to escape and sometimes to reconnect with reality or to create other realities.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>WTF is time?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Time is an abstract concept created as an observation of the world as humans. It is only a quantifiable numerical guide to context. As to satisfy the pleasure of humans' control over nature. Although, also, humans over humans. <br>
          <br>
          Time is also a physical magnitude for physically understanding the world. It is the amount of space between actions. <br>
          <br>
          But as a metaphysical world, each of us has a different sense of time. Depending on the point of reference we choose, time and its connotations (speed, spaces, acceleration, forces, energy, etc.) will play a different role,
          so it doesn't matter which time you want to choose, because all times are correlated when choosing two points. Also, since we live in society, connecting this time makes us think that we live in the same reality. <br>
          <br>
          Finally, I will add that our minds do not function in a linear time, but we constantly travel around this "timeline", we develop other paths. Each mind has its own topographies of time.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>If you have the possibility to do something in the past it means that the future will change. There are always small actions that could change the world, and that does not mean for the better. As none of the actions I want to change the future, I have decided to try to do a small action to create a memory. Although there are many variables that could still make something catastrophic happen. </p>
