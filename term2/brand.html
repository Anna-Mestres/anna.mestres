          This is my main purpose and vision of the brand, if there is any brand, that I would like to attend at this time.

          <li>Can you use your Purpose Pillars (the ones on the previous page) to tell me why this is YOUR story? Why its your brand?

          That Hume was right, about "all our "ideas", or weaker perceptions, are copies of our "impressions" or more intense perceptions".

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <br>
        <p>In the different states in which we live, converting everything towards a selling product causes me anxiety. Everything is subject to a monetary power, or else entertainment to not think and only spend. This psychoanalytic analysis of the stakeholders in order to attract the most, is the purpose of all projects. But it seems to me at the same time that it falls into a fundamental error; the massification. You obviously decide where to focus and what your intentions are. But in the end, all recognition is little.<br>
          <br>
          Let us understand how the world works first. What distinguishes us from the machines is that we constantly make mistakes and are in many cases chaotic. This fact causes that many times the words we name are contradictory to each other. Therefore the fact that there is a human rights declaration does not prohibit the contradiction of this, such as the difference of interpretation. Starting from here, in the economic system we do not all have the same value for the world, systematically then we are not equal. Therefore, we do not have the same power of interaction. And this is where the psychoanalysis of the stakeholders falls into error, since it obviously rates everyone as different but does not worry about analyzing the errors that this can cause. It does not worry about the psychological repercussions that this can happen in triggering a control and manipulation of the facts. Creating a massification of the idea in the profiles sought, uniting and separating more, leaving the individual at the end without being more than part of the mass. And this whole complex system is, at the same time, necessary to be able to create content that reaches somewhere.
