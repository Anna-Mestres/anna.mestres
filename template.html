          <p>I took this picture in 2019, in France. I like it because in someway is like my brain, somethings I can see very clear, others are just superimposed and others are just solid colours. <br> I am an Industrial Designer. <br> I am currently coursing the Master in Design for Emergent Futures, in IAAC. And in this website you can follow my research and development.</p>
