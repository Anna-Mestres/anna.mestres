        For the MDEF we want to connect our projects (Anna, Borka & Kai) and show it in an interactive way, since we all work with children and games. So, we have decided to create a Gymkhana, apart from the other activities that will be done, with our toys. So the goal is to recreate the route and information online of the Gymkhana for the MDEF Fest. With a 360 camera and the tool of Marzipano.

      <p>I had never taken pictures with a 360 camera before and never used the Marzipano software. It has been very interesting to work with these two tools. As well as working with web development. <br>
        <br>
        For this fabchallenge I have been involved in the creation of the website for the interface. Trying to understand JavaScript, jason, html and css. Although by bad luck I have not been able to apply the videos I wanted. I'm going to try to implement it in another way to be able to embed videos in the interactive circuit of the gymkhana.

      <p>Finally this has been the result after taking the 360 photos and implementing it on the Marzipano website.</p>
