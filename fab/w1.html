                    To make the report I choose
                    <a href="https://krzysztof_wronski.gitlab.io/wrona/reflections/fablab-reports.html">Krzysztof Wronski</a>,
                    <a href="https://josefina_nano.gitlab.io/mdef-website/fabacademy12.html">Josefina Nano</a> and
                    <a href="https://roger_guilemany.gitlab.io/mdef-website/fabacademy.html#faw1">Roger Guilemany</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    I have chosen these three websites because each one is a little different from the others in terms of presentation, but all three have in common that weekly separation, and not only thematic. As well as a chronological order. This makes the process of creation and personal development much more understandable
                    <br><br>
                    Krzysztof tells very well what he is working on and how he develops it, also his thoughts. As does Roger, who in a very honest way his hypotheses, facts and conclusions. Unlike Josefina, he arranges each week by Facts, Feelings, Findings and Future, making the work of reflection much more schematic, and as a consequence, practical.

                  <p>
                  During the course of Designing for the Next Billion Seconds we were asked < WTF is internet? >, to which I responded:<br>
                  <br>
                  <em>It’s about a global connection of computers.<br>
                    A billions of connections where you can find everything, as an implication of something.<br>

                    I will say it is the algebraic image of computers in our lives, but maybe in the future it will be the metaverse.<br>

                    A few years ago I thought about it. I realised that we systematically search the internet for what we want to know. So in my opinion, for humans, it's not just a way to connect, it's a way to escape and sometimes to reconnect with reality or to create other realities.
                  </em><br>
                  <br>
                  Also few years ago I made this <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CAK5w68n9w8/?utm_medium=copy_link">video</a> because of the idea that internet has become everything in our education system.

                <br>
                  <p>For the 3D model I wanted to try with Rhino, because I already control Fusion, SolidEdge and NX. Also, I thought about Blender, but I see more future working with Rhino than Blender, as it is also a a software for animation even if you can use as an engineer.
                    <br>I had some problems with Rhino, so for the next week I will try to work only with Rhino, but for now I did this model with Fusion.

                    <br>The idea not only came from Magritte, it's also a reflection of the shapes of cotidiant objects. As depending of the cultural, social and political sociology in the time.

                    As you might expect, I had not used the laser cutter until I joined this master. Therefore, this is all new to me. As I said I forced myself to do the following task in rhino, to learn it. First I made a design of a piece of furniture as an easel in order to be able to engrave working processes from above. But when I finished I realised that the measurements were bigger than the piece of wood I had. So I designed a puzzle, as my focus of work is games and thinking.
                    <br>
                  </p>
                  <br>

                  <img alt="puzzle laser cut rhino" src="../images/fab/process.png">

                  <br>
                  <p>
                    The different types of processes to be implemented must be differentiated in the colours. The red will be engraving, the image and the text will be rastering as High, while the blue will be cutting. If cutting is done before engraving, the piece can move and become misaligned with the original design. Therefore the engraving will be done first and then the cut.
                    <br><br>
                    When opening the document in the rhino 5 of the computer connected to the laser, it only allows to choose the engraving or cutting mode, so even if it read the image as engraving, it did not transfer the information well. What we did with Josep then was to separate the file in two. First we printed the engraving without the cut. And then we printed the cut without the engraving. Thanks to the machine remembering the starting point, and obviously we didn't move the board.

                    Although it is a great process of creation, it is obviously not made for a mass production process. For small parts it is perfect, but once you start working with large and detailed parts, you lose a lot of time. As well as the energy consumption and toxic fumes it produces. But in the end it is an essential tool for producing details.<br>
                    <br>
                  </p>
                  <p> I encourage you to create a new puzzle, personify it by changing the image (remember that in black and white the laser engrave much better). <br>

                    The printer I’ve decided to use to make the part is the creality LD-002H. This printer is resin, in this case Plant-based Elegoo translucent resin has been used. Rhino has been used together with Grasshopper to create the modeling. And the software for the machine has been chitubox.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>The main idea of the object I would like to create is a version of the puzzle that contains two identical pieces and creates a pyramid between them. Since geometry is stipulated by the game itself, I would like to play with void and organic shapes.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>Process</h2>
                  <br>
                  <p>Since I had never used the GrassHopper tool I have looked for some tutorial to be able to make some dynamic form of my main idea. So I followed the following <a href="https://youtu.be/tpazyRd_t-I">YouTube tutorial.</a>
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <img alt="rhino Grasshopper" src="../images/fab/3d/rhino.png">
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <p>After creating the mesh, it has been saved in stl format and opened the chitubox program. As is the program recommended by the same company Creality, this already contains a library with different resin 3D printers. And since I’ve worked with this program before, it’s already programmed for the machine in question.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The process is basically to scale it as it seems perfect. Because it’s a design that only depends on the two pieces being the same, we don’t care so much about the exact size. And adding brackets to the piece. Being a piece with many holes and angles not very well if the machine will be able to correctly capture the shape, so and to facilitate its extraction without damaging the design, we must add supports (very rarely in resin is not necessary the supports).<br>
                    <br>
                    From past experiences and as you can see it is obvious that once printed it will be very difficult to remove the supports. For this reason I have decided to print two parts with different support; one with support made automatically by the machine, and in the other I have manually removed the inner support. In this way we will be able to check if the part really needs the inner supports or not.
                  </p>

                    For this activity we have learned to use kicad to be able to manufacture a pcb board. As Julia wants to create a dehydrator, which I am also very interested in, we have decided to do the activity together. Therefore we have created a PCB board with a temperature sensor and an AC drimmer necessary to change the intensity of the infrareds.
                  </p><br>
                  These are the resources we found on the internet. Thanks to this <a href="https://youtu.be/lQOzLP1lMJU">video</a>, we were able to understand how AC drimmer worked and make one. In it you can find the necessary components to manufacture it and all the information of how it works.
                  <br><br>
                  During the process we needed Jeremy’s help, who really explained what we needed and how it worked. Also Daphne and Santi to be able to understand well the connections between the elements.

                  <h2>The Process</h2>
                  <br>
                  <p>This is the scheme that Julia created with Jeremy, to understand what components we needed. Then we find the AC drimmer scheme, which for its high cost we decided to manufacture one instead of buying it, extracted from the previous video.
                  </p>

                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <p>The tricky part is finding the parts needed to produce the dehydrator. After finding both symbols and footprint documents. But once this is all must be installed in the kidCad repository, the symbol in Schematic Layout Editor and the footprint in PCB Layout Editor. It must be understood that the symbology serves to make a diagram of the circuit, in terms of footprint, serves to create the real connections and paths between the components with their real measure.
                    <br><br>
                    Once the entire export process is done and we have the idea of the system we can start to create first the document Schematic Layout Editor, then generate netlist and with it open the PCB Layout Editor.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  On Jeremy’s recommendation, the high volatge has been separated with the low, to avoid overloads.

                    For this practice I have decided to make some modular pieces. The intention is that children can create their own furniture when they play. For this reason it is necessary to fit and unfit the pieces together. So that children can play with them easily, but at the same time they can support the weight of a child. The dimensions of the pieces will be 330 mm, which is the average size of a seat for a 5 year old child.

                  <p>Next, the thickness of the board (1200 x 1200 mm) has been measured, 14mm. Therefore a tolerance of 2mm has been left for the hole.

                  <p>Once the process is finished, we have to remove the screws. And proceed to separate the pieces from the wooden panel. Once done, we can see that the surface finish of the wood, especially in the cut areas, is bad. This is why we must file, so as not to leave any wood chips that could hurt us.

                    We created the pcb with Julia, so the work was done between the two of us. The idea is to create a board to control the temperature with the led lights, in order to create a dehydrator. First the board was printed after checking that everything was ok with Edu.

                  <p>We had problems with the printing because the tip of the milling machine could not cut the copper completely. We assumed that this plate was curved and therefore from a certain point it did not have the same contact as at the edges. In the end we were lucky that they helped us to balance it in a different way than the staff had told us. We put the tip all the way in and then lowered it a bit more to give it speed. Finally it worked and we were able to print our plate correctly.
