                    To make the report I choose
                    <a href="https://krzysztof_wronski.gitlab.io/wrona/reflections/fablab-reports.html">Krzysztof Wronski</a>,
                    <a href="https://josefina_nano.gitlab.io/mdef-website/fabacademy12.html">Josefina Nano</a> and
                    <a href="https://roger_guilemany.gitlab.io/mdef-website/fabacademy.html#faw1">Roger Guilemany</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    I have chosen these three websites because each one is a little different from the others in terms of presentation, but all three have in common that weekly separation, and not only thematic. As well as a chronological order. This makes the process of creation and personal development much more understandable
                    <br><br>
                    Krzysztof tells very well what he is working on and how he develops it, also his thoughts. As does Roger, who in a very honest way his hypotheses, facts and conclusions. Unlike Josefina, he arranges each week by Facts, Feelings, Findings and Future, making the work of reflection much more schematic, and as a consequence, practical.

                  <h2>Reflection</h2><br>
                  <p>
                  During the course of Designing for the Next Billion Seconds we were asked < WTF is internet? >, to which I responded:<br>
                  <br>
                  <em>It’s about a global connection of computers.<br>
                    A billions of connections where you can find everything, as an implication of something.<br>

                    I will say it is the algebraic image of computers in our lives, but maybe in the future it will be the metaverse.<br>

                    A few years ago I thought about it. I realised that we systematically search the internet for what we want to know. So in my opinion, for humans, it's not just a way to connect, it's a way to escape and sometimes to reconnect with reality or to create other realities.
                  </em><br>
                  <br>
                  Also few years ago I made this <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CAK5w68n9w8/?utm_medium=copy_link">video</a> because of the idea that internet has become everything in our education system.

                <br>
                  <p>For the 3D model I wanted to try with Rhino, because I already control Fusion, SolidEdge and NX. Also, I thought about Blender, but I see more future working with Rhino than Blender, as it is also a a software for animation even if you can use as an engineer.
                    <br>I had some problems with Rhino, so for the next week I will try to work only with Rhino, but for now I did this model with Fusion.

                    <br>The question of the beer it would be, <em>What happens when we are not what we are suppose to be?</em><br>
                    <br>The idea not only came from Magritte, it's also a reflection of the shapes of cotidiant objects. As depending of the cultural, social and political sociology in the time.

                    As you might expect, I had not used the laser cutter until I joined this master. Therefore, this is all new to me. As I said I forced myself to do the following task in rhino, to learn it. First I made a design of a piece of furniture as an easel in order to be able to engrave working processes from above. But when I finished I realised that the measurements were bigger than the piece of wood I had. So I designed a puzzle, as my focus of work is games and thinking.
                    <br>
                  </p>
                  <br>

                  <br>
                  <p>
                    The different types of processes to be implemented must be differentiated in the colours. The red will be engraving, the image and the text will be rastering as High, while the blue will be cutting. If cutting is done before engraving, the piece can move and become misaligned with the original design. Therefore the engraving will be done first and then the cut.
                    <br><br>
                    When opening the document in the rhino 5 of the computer connected to the laser, it only allows to choose the engraving or cutting mode, so even if it read the image as engraving, it did not transfer the information well. What we did with Josep then was to separate the file in two. First we printed the engraving without the cut. And then we printed the cut without the engraving. Thanks to the machine remembering the starting point, and obviously we didn't move the board.

                    Although it is a great process of creation, it is obviously not made for a mass production process. For small parts it is perfect, but once you start working with large and detailed parts, you lose a lot of time. As well as the energy consumption and toxic fumes it produces. But in the end it is an essential tool for producing details.<br>
                    <br>
                  </p>
                  <p> I encourage you to create a new puzzle, personify it by changing the image (remember that in black and white the laser engrave much better). <br>

                    The printer I’ve decided to use to make the part is the creality LD-002H. This printer is resin, in this case Plant-based Elegoo translucent resin has been used. Rhino has been used together with Grasshopper to create the modeling. And the software for the machine has been chitubox.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>The main idea of the object I would like to create is a version of the puzzle that contains two identical pieces and creates a pyramid between them. Since geometry is stipulated by the game itself, I would like to play with void and organic shapes.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h2>Process</h2>
                  <br>
                  <p>Since I had never used the GrassHopper tool I have looked for some tutorial to be able to make some dynamic form of my main idea. So I followed the following <a href="https://youtu.be/tpazyRd_t-I">YouTube tutorial.</a>
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <img alt="rhino Grasshopper" src="../images/fab/3d/rhino.png">
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <p>After creating the mesh, it has been saved in stl format and opened the chitubox program. As is the program recommended by the same company Creality, this already contains a library with different resin 3D printers. And since I’ve worked with this program before, it’s already programmed for the machine in question.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The process is basically to scale it as it seems perfect. Because it’s a design that only depends on the two pieces being the same, we don’t care so much about the exact size. And adding brackets to the piece. Being a piece with many holes and angles not very well if the machine will be able to correctly capture the shape, so and to facilitate its extraction without damaging the design, we must add supports (very rarely in resin is not necessary the supports).<br>
                    <br>
                    From past experiences and as you can see it is obvious that once printed it will be very difficult to remove the supports. For this reason I have decided to print two parts with different support; one with support made automatically by the machine, and in the other I have manually removed the inner support. In this way we will be able to check if the part really needs the inner supports or not.
                  </p>
