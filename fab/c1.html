        <h2>CREUAR</h2>
        <h3>by <a href="https://jose-hirmas.github.io/mdefportafolio/fab%20academy/Challenges/">José Hirmás</a>, <a href="https://borbalamoravcsik.github.io/mdef-borka/Fabacademy-challenge1.html">Borbala Moravcsik</a> and Anna Mestres.</h3>
        <br>
        <p><em>Here you can find the <a href="https://github.com/Anna-Mestres/fab_challenge_I">repository</a> of our first challange.</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Our goal is to create a participatory game, between different generations. That’s why we created Creuar.
          <br><br>
          Every day we communicate with each other, most of the time we don’t hear or understand each other. In addition, Creuar understands participation as an equitable opportunity, in this case to speak and collaborate. That’s why we develop a game where collaboration among all is mandatory, and when someone falls we all do. It is a metaphor for the network where we live, and also an opportunity to break the individualism and competitiveness that surrounds us.
          <br><br>
          Our purpose was to make a game as open as we could, so one of the main themes is to make your own rules in the game. Develop your own imagination to create your own unique game. Participation must also break the rules of the generations, since everyone can participate and bring new points of view.

          <p><em>The goal is to have the same shapes on all the ropes.</em> <br>
            <br>
            There are different shapes randomly placed on all the ropes. In order to have another form, you must ask one of the people with the form you want a question related to your subject, and they must answer with an answer that the form demands (emotion, fact, memory, crazy). Once this is done, you can move the shape of the rope to yours.
